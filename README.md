# [Project 1 Description: Descriptive Analysis of Lost and Found Animal Records](https://busi-653-codes.github.io/City-of-Vancouver-DAP-Project-Part-1-Peddaballe-Vinodh-Kumar-Reddy/)
In this assignment I will be describing the details of the City of Vancouver project mainly about the Data Analytic Platform (DAP) implementation (the datasets used and the various derivations and DAP design using the datasets I selected. For this assignment I used the website [City of Vancouver Open Data Portal](https://opendata.vancouver.ca/explore/dataset/animal-control-inventory-lost-and-found/export/?disjunctive.breed&disjunctive.color&sort=date&refine.date=2023) for getting some open source available datasets for various segments related to the Vancouver City operations.
## Project 1 Title: Understanding Yearly Lost and Found Animal Patterns
The primary need of this project is to conduct a descriptive analysis of the yearly trends in lost and found animals based on the datasets taken from [City of Vancouver Open Data Portal](https://opendata.vancouver.ca/explore/dataset/animal-control-inventory-lost-and-found/export/?disjunctive.breed&disjunctive.color&sort=date&refine.date=2023). The goal is to identify the percentage of animals matched (found) and lost over time, which can help inform operational strategies for animal control services, improve response times, and increase the likelihood of reuniting lost animals with their owners.
## Methodology:
* The process of DAP designing and implementation is complex.
* This involves close to 13 different steps. I will be explaining on these steps in detail below:
  * Step 1 - Data Analytical Question Formulation
  * Step 2 - Data Discovery
  * Step 3 - Data Storage Design
  * Step 4: Dataset Preparation
  * Step 5: Data Ingestion
  * Step 6: Data Storage
  * Step 7: Data Pipeline Design
  * Steps 8 : Data Cleaning
  * Steps 9: Data Structuring
  * Step 10: Data Pipeline Implementation
  * Step 11: Data Analysis
  * Step 12: Data Visualization
  * Step 13: Data Publishing
 ## The lsit of Tools or technologies used for Project 1 are:
  * Microsoft Excel
  * AWS-S3
  * AWS-DataBrew
  * AWS-Glue
  * AWS-Athena
  * AWS-EC2
  * Microsoft Web Server IIS Role Installation <br>

# [Project 2 Description: Exploratory Analysis of Lost and Found Animal Records](https://busi-653-codes.github.io/City-of-Vancouver-DAP-Project-Part-2-Peddaballe-Vinodh-Kumar-Reddy/)
In this assignment I will be describing the details of the City of Vancouver project mainly about the Data concerns of the Data Analytic Platform (DAP) implemented previously. For this assignment I used the processed and published dataset information from website [City of Vancouver Open Data Portal](https://opendata.vancouver.ca/explore/dataset/animal-control-inventory-lost-and-found/export/?disjunctive.breed&disjunctive.color&sort=date&refine.date=2023).
## Project 2 Title: Understanding the process of ensuring Data Protection, Governance, & Monitoring for DAP
The primary need of this project is to conduct a exploratory analsis of the process of providing and ensuring the Data Protection, Governance, & Monitoring for DAP model i developed in the previous assignment. This project mainly deals with the process after the basic model fo DAP is developed and implemented. This project mainly discusses on the various tools and technologies used in providing Data Protection, Governance, & Monitoring for DAP model developed.
## Methodology:
* The process of Designing and implementing the Data Protection, Governance, & Monitoring for DAP model is complex.
* This involves 4 different steps. I will be explaining on these steps in detail below:
  * Step 14: Data Enriching
  * Step 15: Data Protection
  * Step 16: Data Governance
  * Step 17: Data Monitoring
## The lsit of Tools or technologies used for Project 2 are:
  * AWS-S3
  * AWS-Glue
  * AWS-IAM
  * AWS-KMS
  * AWS-CloudWatch
  * AWS-CloudTrail

# [Project 3 Description: Cost estimation of Lost and Found Animal Records DAP](https://busi-653-codes.github.io/City-of-Vancouver-DAP-Project-Part-3-Cost-Estimation-Peddaballe-Vinodh-Kumar-Reddy/)
In this assignment I will be describing the cost details of AWS Services used for the City of Vancouver project mainly about the Data concerns of the Data Analytic Platform (DAP) implemented previously. For this assignment. In this scenario we will be calculating the cost incurred monthly for setting up the network along with all the services using in the process of DAP. We will be explaining the scenario based on the image below which shows our DAP network details. We will also use the same for calculating cost using “AWS Calculator”.
![figure 47](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cfc3c7c7-7b62-4c2a-a556-121259b0f44d)
* The above image displays the network used for my DAP model.
## Project 3 Title: Understanding Cost Estimation of DAP
The primary need of this project is to conduct a exploratory analsis of the process of estimating the average monthly costs for the AWs services we will be using.
## Project 3 Objective:
* Cost Estimation of AWS Services Used.
## Methodology
* We will be using the [AWS Pricing Calculator](https://calculator.aws/#/) to estimate the cost that we may incur during the DAP process of Lost and Found Animal Records for City of Vancouver.S3 Cost Estimation
* S3 Data Used Information
* AWS Glue Cost Estimation
* VPC Cost Estimation
* API Gateway Cost Estimation
* AWS Athena Cost Estimation
* AWS EC2 Cost Estimation
* AWS Final Cost Estimation
