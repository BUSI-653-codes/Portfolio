# Project 1 Description: Descriptive Analysis of Lost and Found Animal Records
In this assignment I will be describing the details of the City of Vancouver project mainly about the Data Analytic Platform (DAP) implementation (the datasets used and the various derivations and DAP design using the datasets I selected. For this assignment I used the website [City of Vancouver Open Data Portal](https://opendata.vancouver.ca/explore/dataset/animal-control-inventory-lost-and-found/export/?disjunctive.breed&disjunctive.color&sort=date&refine.date=2023) for getting some open source available datasets for various segments related to the Vancouver City operations.
## Project 1 Title: Understanding Yearly Lost and Found Animal Patterns
The primary need of this project is to conduct a descriptive analysis of the yearly trends in lost and found animals based on the datasets taken from [City of Vancouver Open Data Portal](https://opendata.vancouver.ca/explore/dataset/animal-control-inventory-lost-and-found/export/?disjunctive.breed&disjunctive.color&sort=date&refine.date=2023). The goal is to identify the percentage of animals matched (found) and lost over time, which can help inform operational strategies for animal control services, improve response times, and increase the likelihood of reuniting lost animals with their owners.
## Methodology:
* The process of DAP designing and implementation is complex.
* This involves close to 13 different steps. I will be explaining on these steps in detail below:
  * Step 1 - Data Analytical Question Formulation
  * Step 2 - Data Discovery
  * Step 3 - Data Storage Design
  * Step 4: Dataset Preparation
  * Step 5: Data Ingestion
  * Step 6: Data Storage
  * Step 7: Data Pipeline Design
  * Steps 8 : Data Cleaning
  * Steps 9: Data Structuring
  * Step 10: Data Pipeline Implementation
  * Step 11: Data Analysis
  * Step 12: Data Visualization
  * Step 13: Data Publishing
# [Project 2 Description: Exploratory Analysis of Lost and Found Animal Records](https://busi-653-codes.github.io/City-of-Vancouver-DAP-Project-Part-2-Peddaballe-Vinodh-Kumar-Reddy/)
In this assignment I will be describing the details of the City of Vancouver project mainly about the Data concerns of the Data Analytic Platform (DAP) implemented previously. For this assignment I used the processed and published dataset information from website [City of Vancouver Open Data Portal](https://opendata.vancouver.ca/explore/dataset/animal-control-inventory-lost-and-found/export/?disjunctive.breed&disjunctive.color&sort=date&refine.date=2023).
## Project 2 Title: Understanding the process of ensuring Data Protection, Governance, & Monitoring for DAP
The primary need of this project is to conduct a exploratory analsis of the process of providing and ensuring the Data Protection, Governance, & Monitoring for DAP model i developed in the previous assignment. This project mainly deals with the process after the basic model fo DAP is developed and implemented. This project mainly discusses on the various tools and technologies used in providing Data Protection, Governance, & Monitoring for DAP model developed.
